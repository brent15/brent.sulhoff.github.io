			<h2>About Lacrosse</h2>
			<p> Lacrosse is a contact team sport played between
				two teams using a small rubber ball and a long-handled
				stick called a crosse or lacrosse stick.
				It is often considered as a rough sport.The sport
				consists of four positions: midfield, attack, defense
				and goalie. In field lacrosse, attackmen are solely
				offensive players (except on the "ride", when the
				opposition tries to bring the ball upfield and attackmen
				must stop them), defensemen or defenders are solely
				defensive players (except when bringing up the ball,
				which is called a "clear"), the goalie is the last line
				of defense, directly defending the goal, and midfielders
				or "middies" can go anywhere on the field and play
				offense and defense, although in higher levels of
				lacrosse there are specialized offensive and defensive
				middies. Long stick middies only play defense and come
				off on the field on offense, and "fogos"
				(short for face-off get off) who specialize in taking
				face-offs for their team before another player substitutes
				for them.</p>
